                     <h2>The Black Cross Waifu Empire is a VRChat and Discord-based organization that allows its members to travel back into the World War Two era and protect the common VRChat user from a myriad of threats. Lead and governed by their leader, Scharz, the group strives to bring forth the best values of the German military, while also being respectful of players around them.
